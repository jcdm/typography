# Typography
Proper typesetting can help increase reader understanding, because text flows better and is easier to follow. Typography helps with this by applying the following transformations to your text which makes it “properly typeset”:

* Straight quotes ( " and ' ) into “curly” quote HTML entities
* Backticks-style quotes (``like this'') into “curly” quote HTML entities
* Dashes (“--” and “---”) into en- and em-dash HTML entities
* Three consecutive dots (“...”) into an ellipsis HTML entity
* (c), (r), (tm) and (deg) into ©, ®, ™ and ° HTML entities

## Installation
